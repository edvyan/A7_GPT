# A7 AIT-GPT Tasks

## Task 1
1. **Resources Used**: The primary resource utilized in this work is the `Student-Handbook_August-2021.pdf` related to AIT.
2. **AIT-GPT Design**: The AIT-GPT is specifically designed to handle questions related to AIT. A model has been developed for basic interaction based on the designed GPT, as illustrated in `A7_GPT.ipynb`.
3. **Enhancing AIT-GPT with OpenAI Models**: The study includes exploring OpenAI models to enhance AIT-GPT's capabilities. Integrating with OpenAI's GPT models, which can handle a broad spectrum of language tasks, allows them to serve as the primary engine for general inquiries.

## Task 2
1. **Model Accuracy**: The model generally provides correct answers. For example, in response to a query about AIT's courses, it accurately states: "The courses offered at AIT are provided by its School of Engineering and Technology, School of Environment, Resources and Development, and School of Management. These courses cover various fields such as engineering, technology, environment, resources and development, and management."
2. **Model Limitations**: The model shows limitations in elaboration and selection, mainly due to the restricted information available from the school's handbook. Expanding the information sources could significantly improve the model's performance.

## Task 3
1. **Chat Interface Application**: A chat interface application has been developed using Dash.
2. **Model Coherence**: The model generally meets the requirement of generating coherent responses.
3. **Launching the App**: To launch the app, execute the following command in the root folder:

python ./app/app.py
